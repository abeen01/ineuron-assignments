1. How and when to use the AutoSum command in excel?

The AutoSum command in Excel is a quick and easy way to sum a range of cells in a worksheet. To use the AutoSum command, you can follow these steps:

Select the cell where you want the sum to appear. This is typically the cell immediately below or to the right of the range of cells that you want to sum.

Click the "Formulas" tab on the ribbon, and then click the "AutoSum" button in the "Function Library" group.

Excel will automatically select the range of cells that it thinks you want to sum. If the selected range is correct, simply press enter or click the checkmark to complete the command. If the range is incorrect, you can use the mouse to select the correct range of cells or use the arrow keys to adjust the range.

Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Alt =" to quickly activate the AutoSum command.

AutoSum is useful when you want to quickly calculate the total of a range of numbers in a column or row and the numbers are consecutive. It is especially useful when you have large data and you want to get the summary of the data.
