1.  What do you mean by cells in an excel sheet?
answer:
In an Excel spreadsheet, a cell is a single box that is part of a grid of rows and columns. 
Each cell is uniquely identified by its column letter and row number. 
For example, the cell located in column B and row 3 is often referred to as cell B3.
Cells can contain various types of data, including text, numbers, dates, and formulas. 
You can format cells to change their appearance, such as by setting the font, font size, and cell alignment. 
You can also apply cell borders and cell shading to cells to make your spreadsheet more visually appealing.
Cells can be referenced in formulas and functions using their cell address. 
For example, you might use the formula '=SUM(A1:A5)' to add up the values in cells A1 through A5.
You can also manipulate cells using functions and macros. 
For example, you might use the '=SUM()' function to add up the values in a range of cells, 
or you might use a macro to automatically copy data from one cell to another.

2. How can you restrict someone from copying a cell from your worksheet?
answer:
Protect the worksheet: 
You can use the "Protect Sheet" feature to prevent others from making changes to the worksheet, 
including copying cell data. To protect the sheet, go to the "Review" tab and click "Protect Sheet." 
Then, enter a password to protect the sheet. 
Keep in mind that anyone with the password will still be able to make changes to the sheet, including copying cell data.

Lock the cells: 
You can also lock specific cells or ranges of cells so that they cannot be edited or copied. 
To lock cells, select the cells you want to lock, go to the "Home" tab, and click the "Format" button. 
Then, click "Format Cells" and go to the "Protection" tab. Check the "Locked" box and click "OK." 
You can then protect the sheet as described above to prevent others from unlocking the cells.

Use data validation: 
You can use the "Data Validation" feature to restrict the type of data that can be entered into a cell. 
For example, you can use data validation to allow only numbers or dates to be entered into a cell. 
To use data validation, select the cell or cells you want to validate, go to the "Data" tab, and click "Data Validation." 
Then, select the validation criteria you want to use.

Keep in mind that these methods are not foolproof, and someone with sufficient knowledge and resources may still be able to copy cell data 
from your worksheet.

3.How to move or copy the worksheet into another workbook?
answer:
To move or copy a worksheet from one workbook to another in Excel, you can use the following steps:

Open both the workbook containing the sheet you want to move or copy, and the workbook you want to move or copy the sheet to.
In the workbook containing the sheet you want to move or copy, click on the sheet tab for the sheet you want to move or copy.
Right-click on the sheet tab and select either "Move or Copy" from the context menu.
In the "Move or Copy" dialog box, select the workbook you want to move or copy the sheet to from the "To book" drop-down list.
Choose whether you want to move or copy the sheet by selecting "Move to end" or "Create a copy" in the "Before sheet" drop-down list.
If you want to move the sheet to a specific location within the destination workbook, 
select the sheet you want the moved or copied sheet to be placed before in the "Before sheet" drop-down list.
Click "OK" to move or copy the sheet.
Note: If you are moving a sheet, it will be removed from the original workbook. 
If you are copying a sheet, both the original and the copy will remain in their respective workbooks.

4. Which key is used as a shortcut for opening a new window document?
answer:
In Excel, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + N to quickly open a new, blank workbook.
This will open a new window with a new, blank workbook, allowing you to start working on a new spreadsheet.
Alternatively, you can also use the Ctrl + O shortcut to open an existing workbook. 
This will open the "Open" dialog box, where you can select a workbook to open.
You can also use the Ctrl + W shortcut to close the current workbook.
These shortcuts may vary depending on your operating system and the version of Excel you are using.

5.What are the things that we can notice after opening the Excel interface?
After opening the Excel interface, you will typically see the following elements:
1.	Ribbon: This is the top toolbar that contains tabs for different categories of commands and tools, such as "Home," "Insert," and "Data." You can use the ribbon to access various features and functions in Excel.
2.	Column headings: These are the letters at the top of the spreadsheet that represent the columns. Each column is identified by a letter, starting with A and going through to XFD (which is column 16,384).
3.	Row headings: These are the numbers on the left side of the spreadsheet that represent the rows. Each row is identified by a number, starting with 1 and going down as you move further down the sheet.
4.	Cells: These are the individual boxes that make up the grid of the spreadsheet. Each cell is uniquely identified by its column letter and row number.
5.	Formulas and functions: These are used to perform calculations or perform specific tasks on data in the spreadsheet. Formulas begin with an equal sign (=) and can include cell references and functions.
6.	Chart: This is a graphical representation of data in the spreadsheet. You can create a chart by selecting a range of cells and going to the "Insert" tab and clicking on the "Chart" button.
7.	Page layout: This includes elements such as margins, page orientation, and page size. You can access page layout options by going to the "Page Layout" tab.
8.	Status bar: This is the bar at the bottom of the Excel window that displays information about the current spreadsheet, such as the number of rows and columns, the sum of selected cells, and the current page number.

6. When to use a relative cell reference in excel?
A relative cell reference in Excel refers to a cell address that adjusts when you copy or move a formula that contains the reference. 
For example, if you have a formula in cell A1 that refers to cell B1, and you copy that formula to cell A2, the cell reference in the copied formula will change to B2. 
This is because the reference is relative to the position of the formula.
Relative cell references are useful when you want to apply the same formula to a range of cells, but you want the cell references in the formula to adjust based on the position of the formula. 
For example, you might use a relative cell reference in a formula that sums up the values in a range of cells, such as ‘=SUM(A1:A5)’. 
When you copy this formula to cell B1, the cell reference will change to ‘=SUM(B1:B5)’, which will sum up the values in the next column.

Relative cell references are the default in Excel, so you don't need to do anything special to use them.
If you want to use an absolute cell reference, which does not change when you copy or move a formula, 
you can use the $ symbol before the column letter and row number in the cell reference. 
For example, the absolute cell reference for cell B1 would be ‘$B$1’.
