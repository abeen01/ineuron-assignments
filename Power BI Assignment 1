1. What do you mean by BI? Explain.

BI stands for Business Intelligence. Business intelligence (BI) refers to the technologies, applications and practices for the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of business information. The goal of BI is to support better business decision-making by enabling business users to access and analyze corporate data to make more informed business decisions.

Business Intelligence includes various tools, technologies, and methodologies that enable organizations to gain insights from their data. Some examples of BI tools include data visualization tools, dashboards, reporting tools, data warehousing, and data mining. These tools are used to collect, store, access, and analyze business data, as well as to create reports, summaries, and visualizations that help users understand the data.

Business Intelligence also includes the process of identifying, gathering and analyzing data in order to provide insights into business performance. This process typically involves the collection of data from various internal and external sources, the cleansing and integration of that data, and the application of analytical and statistical techniques to uncover insights and trends.

Business Intelligence can help organizations to improve their performance by providing insights into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and financial performance. Some of the benefits of Business Intelligence includes:

-Improved decision making

-Increased operational efficiency

-Improved customer service

-Better strategic planning

-Increased profitability

-Improved risk management

Overall, Business Intelligence is an essential tool for organizations looking to understand and improve their performance by gaining insights from their data

2. Explain Descriptive analytics?Descriptive analytics is a type of business intelligence that is used to summarize and describe data. The main goal of descriptive analytics is to provide a summary of historical data, and to understand what happened in the past.

It involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. This can be done using various statistical techniques such as frequency distributions, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc. Descriptive analytics also includes data visualization techniques such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, etc. to present the data in an easy-to-understand format.

Descriptive analytics is commonly used in various applications such as:

Financial analysis: to understand past financial performance, identify trends, and make predictions about future performance.

Marketing analysis: to understand customer behavior, identify customer segments, and make decisions about targeting and positioning.

Sales analysis: to understand sales trends, identify best-selling products, and make decisions about product mix and pricing.

Operations analysis: to understand production and supply chain performance, identify bottlenecks, and make decisions about capacity and inventory management.

Fraud detection: to identify patterns of fraudulent behavior and make decisions about risk management.

Human resources analysis: to understand employee behavior, identify patterns in employee turnover, and make decisions about recruitment, retention, and employee development.

Descriptive analytics provides a summary of historical data, which can help organizations to understand the past and make better decisions about the future. It is a valuable tool for organizations looking to gain insights from their data and make data-driven decisions.

3. Explain Predictive analytics?

Predictive analytics is a type of business intelligence that uses data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. The main goal of predictive analytics is to make predictions about future events, and to identify patterns and trends in data that can be used to make better decisions.

Predictive analytics involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources, building models to identify patterns and trends in the data, and making predictions about future events based on those models. This can be done using various statistical techniques such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and machine learning algorithms.
