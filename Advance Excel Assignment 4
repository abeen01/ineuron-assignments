1. To use the ribbon commands, what menu and grouping of commands will you
find the Insert and Delete command?

In Microsoft Excel, the Insert and Delete commands can be found in the "Home" tab of the ribbon, under the "Cells" group of commands. Specifically, the "Insert" command is located in the "Cells" group, and the "Delete" command is located in the "Delete" drop-down button of the "Cells" group.

2. If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and
column?

If you set the row height or column width to 0 (zero) in Microsoft Excel, the row or column will not be visible on the worksheet. This effectively "hides" the row or column, and any data or formatting within it will not be visible or accessible until the height or width is increased from 0.

3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?

In Microsoft Excel, changing the height and width of a cell can be useful for several reasons:

To make the data in the cell more legible: If the default height and width of a cell are too small, the text within the cell can be difficult to read. Increasing the height and width can make the text more visible and easier to read.

To make better use of the available space on the worksheet: By default, Excel will adjust the height and width of cells based on the amount of data in them. However, if you want to make better use of the available space on the worksheet, you can manually adjust the height and width of cells to fit more data on the screen.

To improve the overall layout and design of the worksheet: Changing the height and width of cells can help you create a more visually appealing and organized worksheet.

To fix the overflow of text from cells or to fit the contents of the cells.

In summary, changing the height and width of cells can help improve the readability, organization, and design of the worksheet.
