2. What limitations of Excel, Microsoft solved by PowerBi?

Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft that is designed to overcome some of the limitations of Excel, such as limited data visualization capabilities and difficulty in sharing and collaborating on data analysis. Power BI allows users to easily connect to a variety of data sources, create interactive and visually appealing dashboards, and share those dashboards with others. Additionally, Power BI has advanced data modeling and analysis capabilities, such as support for DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and the ability to create calculated columns and measures. It also provides robust data visualization options, such as charts, maps, and tables, and the ability to create interactive reports.

3 Explain PowerQuery?

Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool that is built into Microsoft Excel and Power BI. It allows users to connect to a wide variety of data sources, including databases, spreadsheets, and web services, and then perform a variety of data transformations to clean, reshape, and combine data.

Power Query uses a visual, user-friendly interface that enables users to easily filter, sort, and group data, as well as perform calculations and create new columns. It also supports more advanced data transformations such as pivot, unpivot, and merge operations.

One of the key features of Power Query is its support for 'query folding' which allows it to push as much of the data processing as possible back to the data source. This is particularly useful when working with large data sets or when connecting to a data source over a slow network connection.

Power Query also allows users to save and share their data transformations, enabling teams to collaborate and build on each other's work. The queries can be saved as part of a workbook in Excel or as a standalone connection in the Power BI Desktop.

Overall, Power Query is a powerful tool that makes it easy to connect to and work with data from a variety of sources, and to perform complex data transformations without the need for manual coding.

4 Explain PowerMap?

Power Map is a 3D data visualization tool that is built into Microsoft Excel and is part of the Power BI suite of tools. It allows users to create interactive maps and visualizations of their data, and to explore that data in a geographic context.

Power Map allows users to plot data points on a map, and to customize the appearance of the map by adjusting the colors, labels, and other visual elements. It also supports a variety of map styles, including street, satellite, and terrain maps.

Users can also create animations in Power Map that show how their data changes over time. This can be particularly useful for visualizing trends and patterns in data that are geographically based, such as population growth or weather patterns.

Power Map also integrates with other Power BI tools, such as Power Query, allowing users to combine data from multiple sources and to perform complex data transformations before visualizing it in the map.

One of the key features of Power Map is its ability to create tours, which are a series of map views with a corresponding voiceover or text, that can be used to tell a story with the data.

Overall, Power Map is a powerful data visualization tool that allows users to easily explore and understand their data in a geographic context and create interactive and visually appealing maps.

5. How powerBi eliminated the need to host SharePoint Server on premises?

Power BI eliminates the need to host SharePoint Server on-premises by providing a cloud-based platform for creating, publishing, and sharing business intelligence and data visualization content.

In the past, to share and collaborate on data analysis and visualization in Excel and Power BI, organizations had to host a SharePoint Server on-premises. This would require significant IT resources and maintenance to keep the server up-to-date and secure.

With Power BI, all content is hosted on Microsoft's cloud-based platform, Azure. This means that users can access their data and visualizations from anywhere with an internet connection, and can collaborate on that data and those visualizations with their team members in real-time.

Additionally, Power BI provides a variety of sharing and collaboration features, such as the ability to share dashboards and reports with others, as well as the ability to set permissions and access controls, which makes it easy for teams to work together on data analysis and visualization projects.

In summary, Power BI eliminates the need to host SharePoint Server on-premises by providing a cloud-based platform for creating, publishing, and sharing business intelligence and data visualization content, which enables users to access and collaborate on the data and visualizations from anywhere with an internet connection, and eliminates the need of IT maintenance and resources.
