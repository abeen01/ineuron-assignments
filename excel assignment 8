1 What do you mean by AutoComplete feature in Excel and what are the
benefits of using this feature?
AutoComplete is a feature in Excel that automatically suggests the rest of a word or a value that you are typing based on previously entered text in the same column. When you start typing a value or a formula in a cell, Excel looks for matching values or formulas in the cells above or below the current cell, and displays a dropdown list of suggested values. You can select a suggested value from the dropdown list by using the arrow keys or by clicking on it, and Excel will automatically fill in the remaining characters for you.

The benefits of using the AutoComplete feature in Excel include:

Time-saving: AutoComplete can save you time by quickly suggesting the rest of a word or a value that you are typing, instead of having to manually type out the entire value or formula.

Accuracy: AutoComplete can help reduce typing errors by suggesting values that have already been entered in the same column.

Consistency: AutoComplete can help you maintain consistency in your data by suggesting previously entered values and avoiding typographical errors.

Convenience: AutoComplete is a convenient feature that can help you work more efficiently in Excel, especially when working with large amounts of data.

2. Explain working with workbooks and working with cells.

Working with workbooks in Excel involves creating, opening, saving, and closing workbooks, as well as managing multiple workbooks. A workbook is a file that contains one or more worksheets, which are used to store and organize data. Here are some key tasks involved in working with workbooks:

Creating a new workbook: You can create a new workbook in Excel by clicking on "File" in the ribbon, and then selecting "New". This will open the "New" dialog box, where you can select a template or create a blank workbook.

Closing a workbook: To close a workbook in Excel, click on "File" in the ribbon, and then select "Close". This will close the active workbook.

Managing multiple workbooks: You can work with multiple workbooks in Excel by opening multiple instances of Excel or by using the "View" tab in the ribbon to arrange and switch between open workbooks.

Working with cells in Excel involves entering, formatting, and manipulating data within cells. A cell is a rectangular box in a worksheet that contains data or a formula. Here are some key tasks involved in working with cells:

Entering data: You can enter data into a cell by selecting the cell and typing in the data. You can also use the AutoComplete feature to help you enter data more quickly.

Formatting cells: You can format cells in Excel by changing the font, font size, font color, background color, and other attributes of the text in the cell. You can also use formatting options to change the alignment and border of the cell.

Working with formulas: Formulas are used to perform calculations in Excel, and can be entered into a cell using the "=" sign. You can use a variety of functions to create complex formulas that perform calculations based on the data in other cells.

Manipulating data: You can manipulate data in Excel by copying and pasting, cutting and pasting, or dragging and dropping data from one cell to another. You can also use features like sorting and filtering to organize and analyze data in your worksheet.

Overall, working with workbooks and cells in Excel is a fundamental part of using the software, and involves a variety of tasks related to data organization, manipulation, and analysis.
